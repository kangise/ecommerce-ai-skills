## What You'll Learn

- Generate professional-grade product images with AI (white-background, scene, lifestyle)
- Produce product videos with AI (demo, ad, social-media videos)
- Master each platform's image/video spec requirements
- Build a batch AI visual-content production workflow

> **Core idea**: in 2026, AI product images can cut 80% of photography cost, and lifestyle images convert 22–30% higher than plain white-background images ([Entrepreneur](https://apac.entrepreneur.com/news-and-trends/how-smart-entrepreneurs-are-cutting-product-photography/501040)). The the AI video-generation market was $716.8M in 2025 and is projected to grow at about a 19% CAGR ([Fortune Business Insights](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/ai-video-generator-market-110060)). Sellers who can't do AI visual content are losing competitiveness.

> **Sources:** verified 2026-08 · [Fortune Business Insights AI video generator market report](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/ai-video-generator-market-110060): $716.8M in 2025, projected $2,562.9M by 2032

### 1.2 The three levels of AI visual content

```
Level 1: AI-assisted editing (simplest)
Background removal/replacement (PhotoRoom, Remove.bg)
Image enhancement (upscale, denoise, color grade)
Batch crop and resize
Good for: existing product photos needing quick optimization

Level 2: AI-generated scene images (intermediate)
Real product photo + AI-generated background/scene
Tools: Midjourney, Nano Banana Pro, Ideogram, PhotoRoom AI Staging
No studio, no models needed
Good for: needing lifestyle images on a limited budget

Level 3: full AI generation (advanced)
Generate product images from text descriptions
Generate videos from product images
AI virtual models (apparel category)
Good for: pre-launch concept validation, batch social-media content production
```

### 2.2 Amazon product-image AI generation in practice

**White-background main image (Main Image)**

Amazon main-image requirements: pure white background (RGB 255,255,255), product filling 85%+ of the frame, ≥1000×1000px.

```
AI workflow:
1. Shoot the product with your phone (any background)
2. PhotoRoom / Remove.bg one-click background removal
3. Auto-replace with a pure white background
4. Adjust product position and size (fill 85%+ of the frame)
5. Export at 2000×2000px (Amazon recommended)

Time: 2 min/image (vs 30 min/image traditional photography)
Cost: $0 (PhotoRoom free tier)
```

**Scene / lifestyle images**

```
Method 1: PhotoRoom AI Staging (simplest)
1. Upload the product white-background image
2. Choose a scene template (kitchen/living room/outdoor/desk)
3. AI auto-places the product into the scene
4. Adjust lighting and angle
Time: 1 min/image

Method 2: Midjourney (highest quality)
1. Upload a product reference image to Midjourney
2. Describe the desired scene with a prompt
3. Generate 4 variants, pick the best
4. Fine-tune in Photoshop/Canva
Time: 5–10 min/image

<copy_discipline>
- Never write a feature, material, certification, or result the product doesn't have. Any attribute I didn't state above must not appear in the copy
- For anything sent to a customer (replies, emails, templates), don't make commitments I haven't authorized: refund amounts, compensation, timelines, or exceptions to platform policy must be confirmed by me before they go in
- Flag any claim touching efficacy, safety, environmental, or patent language separately for manual review
</copy_discipline>
```

**Midjourney product-scene image prompt template:**

```
You are a Midjourney prompt expert focused on e-commerce product images.

Product: [name]
Product appearance: [color, material, size description]
Target scene: [use-case description]
Target platform: [Amazon/Shopify/Instagram]
Style: [minimal/warm/professional/outdoor/modern]

Generate 5 Midjourney prompts, each with:
1. The full English prompt (Midjourney only accepts English)
2. Recommended parameters (--ar ratio, --v version, --s stylization)
3. Expected-effect description

5 angles:
- Angle 1: product close-up (white/light background, highlight detail)
- Angle 2: use scene (a lifestyle image of a person using the product)
- Angle 3: environmental scene (product in a natural environment)
- Angle 4: comparison/size reference (product next to a common object)
- Angle 5: creative/concept image (a creative composition for social media)

Midjourney prompt format requirements:
- Open with the subject description
- Include lighting (soft lighting, studio lighting, natural light)
- Include style (photorealistic, commercial photography, lifestyle)
- Include technical parameters (--ar 1:1 --v 6.1 --s 250)

<copy_discipline>
- Never write a feature, material, certification, or result the product doesn't have. Any attribute I didn't state above must not appear in the copy
- For anything sent to a customer (replies, emails, templates), don't make commitments I haven't authorized: refund amounts, compensation, timelines, or exceptions to platform policy must be confirmed by me before they go in
- Flag any claim touching efficacy, safety, environmental, or patent language separately for manual review
</copy_discipline>
<output_format>
Deliver 5 Midjourney prompts as a numbered list, one per required angle (close-up / use scene / environmental scene / size reference / creative), each with 3 labeled parts: ① full English prompt, ② recommended parameters (--ar, --v, --s), ③ expected-effect description.
</output_format>

<self_check>
Before delivering, verify each item and report the result:
① Exactly 5 prompts, one per angle, in the stated order
② Every prompt starts with the subject description and includes lighting + style + technical parameters
③ Product attributes (color/material/size) match the supplied product info exactly — no invented features
④ For Amazon use: main-image prompts must not add text/logos/watermarks; text overlays only on secondary-image prompts <!-- ref: amazon.product_image.main.no_text_overlay -->
⑤ For commercial use, the recommended tool must have an explicit commercial license and prompt records must be kept <!-- ref: content.ai_generated.commercial_license -->
</self_check>
```

### 2.3 Infographic / selling-point image AI generation

Among Amazon's secondary images, the infographic is one of the highest-converting image types:

```
AI infographic workflow:
1. Generate selling-point copy with ChatGPT/Claude (≤8 words per point)
2. Choose an infographic template with Canva AI
3. Insert the product image + selling-point copy
4. AI auto-adjusts layout and color
5. Export multiple sizes (Amazon/Shopify/social media)

Canva AI prompt:
"Create a product infographic for [product name], highlighting these 5 features:
1. [selling point 1]
2. [selling point 2]
3. [selling point 3]
4. [selling point 4]
5. [selling point 5]
Style: clean, modern, white background with accent color [brand color]"

<copy_discipline>
- Never write a feature, material, certification, or result the product doesn't actually have. Any attribute I didn't state above must not appear in the copy — this is the number-one cause of listing takedowns and false-advertising complaints
- If you need a selling point I didn't supply, list what you need from me rather than improvising
- Flag any claim touching efficacy, safety, environmental, or patent language separately so I can verify it by hand
</copy_discipline>
```

## 6. Prompt Templates

> **Prompt conventions used here**: the templates below work as-is, but for anything involving numbers, forecasts, or recommendations, paste in [the data-discipline block from F2 §4.3](../0-foundations/f2-prompt-engineering.md#43-the-data-discipline-block-ready-to-paste). It forbids the model from inventing data you didn't supply — the most common failure mode for this class of prompt.

### 6.1 Midjourney e-commerce product-image prompt library

**White-background product image:**
```
[product description], product photography, pure white background, studio lighting,
high resolution, commercial photography, centered composition,
sharp focus, no shadows --ar 1:1 --v 6.1 --s 100
<output_format>
Generate 4 image variants (Midjourney default grid) of the product on a pure white background, studio lighting, no shadows, no text.
</output_format>

<self_check>
Before delivering, verify each item and report the result:
① Background renders pure white (RGB 255,255,255) with no shadows
② No text, logo, watermark, or props appear in the image <!-- ref: amazon.product_image.main.no_text_overlay -->
③ Product color/shape/details match the real product photo exactly
④ Generation prompt + date recorded as provenance for commercial use <!-- ref: content.ai_generated.commercial_license -->
</self_check>
```

**Lifestyle scene image:**
```
[product description] in use, [scene description], lifestyle photography, natural lighting,
warm tones, shallow depth of field, editorial style,
photorealistic --ar 1:1 --v 6.1 --s 250
<output_format>
Generate 4 image variants of the product in the described lifestyle scene, natural lighting, warm tones, photorealistic.
</output_format>

<self_check>
Before delivering, verify each item and report the result:
① The product is clearly present and matches the real product's color/shape/details
② Scene and lighting match the requested scene description
③ If used as an Amazon secondary image, any on-image text stays within 20 words <!-- ref: amazon.product_image.secondary_text.max_words -->
④ Generation prompt + date recorded as provenance for commercial use <!-- ref: content.ai_generated.commercial_license -->
</self_check>
```

**Infographic background:**
```
clean minimal background for product infographic, [brand color] accent color,
geometric shapes, modern design, negative space,
professional layout --ar 1:1 --v 6.1 --s 150
<output_format>
Generate 4 image variants: a clean minimal background for a product infographic, in the brand color, geometric, modern, with negative space reserved for text.
</output_format>

<self_check>
Before delivering, verify each item and report the result:
① Background uses the specified brand accent color and geometric-modern style
② Negative space is left for selling-point text overlay (no text baked into the image)
③ Overlay text planned for the infographic: headline ≤5 words, subtitle ≤15 words <!-- ref: amazon.product_image.secondary_title.max_words --> <!-- ref: amazon.product_image.secondary_subtitle.max_words -->
④ Generation prompt + date recorded as provenance for commercial use <!-- ref: content.ai_generated.commercial_license -->
</self_check>
```

### 6.2 AI video-script generation

```
You are an e-commerce product-video script expert.

Product: [name]
Video type: [product demo / usage tutorial / comparison / brand story]
Target platform: [Amazon/TikTok/Instagram/YouTube]
Video length: [30/60/120s]

Generate a video script with:
1. A shot description for each shot (for the AI video-generation tool)
2. Subtitle/voiceover text
3. Duration marks
4. Recommended AI tools (which tool to generate each shot)
5. Background-music style advice

<copy_discipline>
- Never write a feature, material, certification, or result the product doesn't actually have. Any attribute I didn't state above must not appear in the copy — this is the number-one cause of listing takedowns and false-advertising complaints
- If you need a selling point I didn't supply, list what you need from me rather than improvising
- Flag any claim touching efficacy, safety, environmental, or patent language separately so I can verify it by hand
</copy_discipline>
<output_format>
Deliver the video script as a shot-by-shot table: shot number | duration mark | shot description (for the AI video tool) | subtitle/voiceover text | recommended AI tool | background-music style.
</output_format>

<self_check>
Before delivering, verify each item and report the result:
① Every shot has all 6 columns filled (shot no., duration, description, subtitle/voiceover, tool, music)
② Total duration of shots matches the requested video length (30/60/120s)
③ No feature, material, certification or effect beyond the supplied product info; claims flagged for manual review
④ If AI voice/avatar/imagery is used, note that EU AI Act Art. 50 transparency labeling applies <!-- ref: eu.ai_act.transparency -->
⑤ AI tools recommended must have explicit commercial licenses for commercial use <!-- ref: content.ai_generated.commercial_license -->
</self_check>
```

## 8. Common Traps

<!-- claims: benchmark -->

> These figures are a reference line for judging your own data, not measured market averages. Replace them with your own medians after one cycle.


### Trap 1: using an AI-generated image directly as the Amazon main image
The Amazon main image must be a real photo of the product. AI-generated scene images can be used as secondary images, but for the main image use a real shot + AI background removal.

### Trap 2: ignoring each platform's image policy
Amazon bans text, logos, and watermarks on the main image. AI-generated infographics can only be secondary images.

### Trap 3: inaccurate product details in AI generation
AI may change the product's color, shape, button positions, and other details. After generating, you must manually check the accuracy of product details.

### Trap 4: over-relying on AI generation, ignoring real shots
AI scene images are great, but buyers also need to see real product photos. Suggested ratio: 50% real shots + 50% AI-generated.

### Trap 5: copyright risk
The copyright ownership of images generated by tools like Midjourney is still disputed. For commercial use, prefer tools that explicitly grant a commercial license (Midjourney paid, Adobe Firefly, Canva Pro).

---

## When this doesn't work

- **The physical detail has to be true.** Generated images can build a scene and a mood; they cannot show what that button actually feels like. A buyer receiving something that does not match the photo triggers returns and negative reviews directly, and some platforms treat it as a misleading image. Anything conveying material, colour or size must be a real photograph — keep generated images to scene and atmosphere.
- **The platform now treats AI-generated content separately.** Main-image rules, AI-content labelling requirements and asset review standards have been moving for a few years (the EU AI Act's transparency clause reaches directly into this — see [A6](a6-compliance.md)). Confirm your target platform's current position on generated imagery before you run a batch. Do not apply last year's understanding to this year's volume.
- **You need consistency, not one good image.** A set for one product — main, lifestyle, detail, A+ — has to read as the same brand and the same product. Generation is stochastic: lighting, colour temperature and product orientation drift between runs. Consistency means fixing the seed, running img2img from one reference, or shooting for real and treating the images afterwards.
- **The category buys on trust in the photo.** Jewellery, watches, second-hand goods, anything at a high price point — buyers zoom in hunting for flaws. Generated imagery in these categories carries far more risk than upside: once it is recognised as generated, the cost in trust dwarfs the photography you saved.
