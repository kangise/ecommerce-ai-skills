# AI × Cross-Border E-Commerce Knowledge Hub

> An AAAI China Chapter open-source project

A hands-on AI manual for cross-border e-commerce — 69 chapters covering every step from product research to growth, each with copy-paste prompts.

**This is more than a book.** [`dist/` is a plug-and-play agent capability package](agent/README.md) — a 100-entity domain ontology, 9 installable skills, and an MCP server integration. Claude Code users can install it with two commands; the source is on [GitHub](https://github.com/kangise/ecommerce-ai-skills).

> 🌐 Every chapter is available in all three languages. Use the language switcher (top right) to jump between 中文 / EN / 日本語 on any page — it keeps you on the same chapter.

## Try It First

Copy this into [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) or [Claude](https://claude.ai/) and get results in 30 seconds:

```
You are a senior cross-border e-commerce expert with deep knowledge of the Amazon marketplace.
I want to sell a portable neck fan on Amazon US.
Please provide a quick market feasibility analysis including:
1. Category characteristics (seasonality, competition level, price range)
2. Top 3 competitors' key selling points and main pain points from negative reviews
3. 3 potential differentiation angles
4. Risk alerts (compliance, patents, seasonal inventory risks)
Present key data comparisons in table format.

<data_discipline>
- Specific figures or facts about market data, search volume, competitor performance, regulatory text, or fee rates must come from what I supplied. **Don't fill gaps from memory** — these facts move fast and your version may be stale
- When you need a fact to make a judgment, tell me which official source to verify it against, then stop and ask me
- Tag every conclusion with its source: [supplied by me] or [model inference]

## About the Prompts

All prompt templates in this hub were tested against:

- The T2 workhorse tier of ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini — re-verified July 2026 (current model ids in the [model matrix](resources/model-matrix.md))
- Claude (Opus 4 / Sonnet 4) — March 2026

Results can vary across models. If a prompt underperforms, try another model or add more context at the top of the prompt. AI models iterate quickly — re-validate prompts you rely on periodically.
