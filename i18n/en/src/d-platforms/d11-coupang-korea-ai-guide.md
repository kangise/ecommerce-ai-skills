Product: [name]
Category: [X]
Selling points: [5]
Price: $[X] (about ₩[X])

Please generate a complete Coupang Korean Listing:

1. Product name (상품명, 50-100 characters)
- Format: brand (브랜드) + product name (상품명) + core attribute (핵심속성)
- Include Korean search hot words
- The Coupang title shouldn't be too long (shorter than Amazon)

2. Detailed description (상세설명, 500-800 characters)
- Use honorifics (존댓말)
- Emphasize quality (품질) and safety (안전)
- Include detailed usage instructions and precautions
- Korean consumers like to see certification info (KC certification, etc.)

3. Main features (주요특징, 5 Bullet Points)
- Each starting with a benefit
- Include specific data (size/weight/material)

4. Recommended keywords (추천 키워드, 10)
- Korean category words
- Korean function words
- Korean scene words

5. Image guide (이미지 가이드)
- Image style Korean consumers prefer
- Must-have infographics (size chart, material explanation, certification mark)

Note:
- Korean consumers value the "genuine" (정품) mark
- Emphasize KC certification (Korean safety certification)
- Include A/S (after-sales service) info
- Use honorifics (존댓말), not casual speech (반말)
- Korean consumers are very sensitive to "free shipping" (무료배송)

<data_discipline>
- Specific figures or facts about market data, search volume, competitor performance, regulatory text, or fee rates must come from what I supplied. **Don't fill gaps from memory** — these facts move fast and your version may be stale
- When you need a fact to make a judgment, tell me which official source to verify it against, then stop and ask me
- Tag every conclusion with its source: [supplied by me] or [model inference]
</data_discipline>

<copy_discipline>
- Never write a feature, material, certification, or result the product doesn't actually have. Any attribute I didn't state above must not appear in the copy — this is the number-one cause of listing takedowns and false-advertising complaints
- If you need a selling point I didn't supply, list what you need from me rather than improvising
- Flag any claim touching efficacy, safety, environmental, or patent language separately so I can verify it by hand
</copy_discipline>

<output_format>
Output exactly 5 numbered sections (1. 2. 3. …) matching the requested items, in the same order, each headed with the item's original name; every requested item appears exactly once.
</output_format>

<self_check>
(1) All 5 requested items (You are a Korean e-commerce Listing optimization expert, pro…) are present, numbered in the same order, with none missing or extra. <!-- ref: amazon.bullet_point.count -->
(2) Every figure comes from the pasted data; anything absent is written "missing" — no estimates from memory.
(3) Copy claims no feature/certification/material/result absent from the input, and makes no unauthorized customer commitment.
</self_check>

### 4.1 Rocket Delivery (로켓배송)

Coupang's core competency is Rocket Delivery ([Coupang Q4 2025 Earnings](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/coupang-q4-earnings-call-highlights-2026-02-27/)):
- Next-day delivery (most regions)
- Same-day delivery (Seoul and other major cities)
- Dawn delivery (새벽배송, delivered before 7 AM)
- 100+ logistics centers covering 70% of Korea's population (within 7 miles)

| Logistics option | Description | Ranking impact | Best for |
|------------------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| Rocket Delivery | Coupang warehousing + delivery | Greatly boosts ranking | Products with stable sales |
| Rocket Growth | Cross-border seller-only (overseas warehouse → Korea) | Some weighting | Top choice for cross-border sellers |
| Seller self-shipping | Seller delivers themselves | Lower ranking | Testing phase |

### 4.2 Coupang 2025 Q4 Key Data

Based on Coupang's Q4 2025 earnings report ([MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/coupang-q4-earnings-call-highlights-2026-02-27/)):

| Metric | Data |
|--------|------|
| Q4 revenue | $8.8B (+11% YoY, +14% at constant FX) |

| Product Commerce revenue | +8% YoY |

| 2026 Q1 guidance | Constant-FX revenue growth 5-10% |

> **Note**: Coupang experienced a major data breach in 2025 (33 million accounts affected), causing Q4 profit to drop 97%. The company will issue about $1.2 billion in vouchers to affected users. This may affect platform trust in the short term, but in the long run Coupang's market position in Korea remains solid.

- Use only the numbers I supplied above. Do not assume any parameter I didn't give you (interest rates, industry averages, platform fee rates, exchange rates) — list what's missing and ask
- **Write out the formula before substituting numbers** so I can check each step. Don't give only the final result
- For conclusions involving money or inventory, note which input they're most sensitive to — which number, if I change it, flips the conclusion
- If you can't complete the calculation, stop and say what's missing. Do not fill gaps with assumed values

### 4.3 KC Certification Requirements

> **Related reading**: [A6 Compliance & Risk Control](../a-operators/a6-compliance.md) — the multi-market compliance methodology is referenced in A6, the certification and compliance framework is reusable for Korean KC certification.

## 5. Cross-Border Onboarding in Practice

### 5.1 The Coupang Global Selling Platform

Coupang is building a scalable international-expansion engine, with its new export platform as the key ([AInvest](https://www.ainvest.com/news/coupang-export-platform-scalable-gateway-336-billion-global-market-2602/)). The Korean e-commerce market is expected to grow from $230B in 2024 to $336B by 2027.

The Coupang Global Selling official platform ([globalsellers.coupang.com](https://globalsellers.coupang.com/)) provides an onboarding channel for international sellers.

### 5.2 Onboarding Paths Explained

> **Real case: The Kyoto brand SOU・SOU enters Korea through Coupang**
> The traditional Kyoto textile brand SOU・SOU successfully entered the Korean market through Coupang Global Selling. SOU・SOU is known for fusing traditional Japanese patterns with modern design, and after joining Coupang it quickly became a brand Korean consumers love, proving that a style rooted in tradition can cross borders ([Coupang Global Sellers](https://globalsellers.coupang.com/en/newsroom/sou%E3%83%BBsou-bringing-kyotos-colorful-seasons-to-korea/)).

> **Real case: MITSUYA, from car exports to Japanese consumer goods cross-border**
> The Japanese company MITSUYA CO., LTD. was originally a company exporting Japanese cars and parts. As customer needs changed, the company expanded into international sales of Japanese consumer goods, launching a full overseas direct-purchase service in 2007. Through the Coupang platform, MITSUYA brought products embodying Japanese craftsmanship to the Korean market ([Coupang Global Sellers](https://globalsellers.coupang.com/en/meet-a-seller/delivering-japanese-craftsmanship-to-korea-with-heart/)).

| Path | Description | Barrier | Fees | Best for |
|------|-------------|---------|------|----------|
| Coupang Global Seller | Directly register an international seller account on Coupang | Needs a valid business license, bank account | No monthly rent, by commission | Sellers with some operational capability |
| Rocket Growth | Cross-border logistics plan (overseas warehouse → Korea warehouse → Rocket Delivery) | Needs overseas-warehouse capability | Logistics fee + commission | Sellers wanting the Rocket Delivery tag |
| Korean agency | Onboard and operate through a local Korean agency | Low (the agency handles everything) | Agency fee 15-30% | Sellers without Korean-language ability |
| Korean local company | Register a Korean legal entity, onboard as a local seller | High (needs a Korean company) | Registration fee + operating fee | Long-term deep cultivation of the Korean market |

### 5.3 Global Seller Onboarding Requirements

According to Coupang and industry material ([SellToKorea](https://selltokorea.com/faq/)):

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Business license | A valid corporate business license |
| Bank account | A bank account to receive payments |
| Korean Listing | The product description must include Korean |
| Product images | Clear product images |
| Korean import regulations | Comply with Korean import regulations |
| Category certification | Specific categories may need extra certification (KC, etc.) |

### 5.4 Rocket Growth In-Depth Analysis

Rocket Growth is a 3PL service Coupang designed for cross-border sellers ([Kontactic](https://web.archive.org/web/20260412055042/https://www.kontactic.com/blog/how-to-sell-on-coupang-foreign-brand)). Products fulfilled through Rocket Growth get the Rocket Delivery tag, which significantly boosts the conversion rate and search visibility.

```
Rocket Growth workflow:

Step 1: The seller sends products to an overseas warehouse (China/US/Japan)
↓
Step 2: Coupang transfers from the overseas warehouse to the Korea Coupang warehouse
↓
Step 3: The product gets the Rocket Delivery tag
↓
Step 4: After a buyer orders, Coupang ships from the Korea warehouse
↓
Step 5: Next-day/same-day delivery to the buyer

Advantages:
Get the Rocket Delivery tag (greatly boosts ranking)
Delivery speed the same as local sellers
Returns handled by Coupang
High buyer trust

Disadvantages:
Need to stock the overseas warehouse in advance
Complex inventory management
Higher logistics cost
Risk of slow-moving inventory

</copy_discipline>
```

## 6. Common Traps

### 6.1 Underestimating fulfillment requirements

Coupang's rules are built around delivery speed, and missing the standard directly hits exposure. This isn't "bonus points for doing well" — it's "penalties for falling short." Confirm your fulfillment can meet the bar before onboarding.

### 6.2 Machine-translating Korean

Korean shoppers are sensitive to how local the copy reads; machine-translation artifacts damage trust directly. Similar to the Japanese market in this respect.

### 6.3 Ignoring competition with Coupang's own retail

Platform-owned inventory in your category affects both your traffic and your pricing room. Factor it in during product selection.

### 6.4 Not working out the cash tied up by the settlement cycle

The settlement cycle determines how much working capital you need — a hard constraint when stocking for peak season.

---

## When this doesn't work

- **Your Korean is merely legible.** This market is sensitive to register and honorific level, traces of machine translation cost trust directly, and it shows most in support replies. A native speaker has to pass over the final text — the same rule as Japan, and not optional.
- **You are not using the platform's own logistics.** Buyer expectations on delivery speed here are set by the platform's in-house network. Running third-party or cross-border direct shipping puts you behind on a gap that shows up immediately in conversion and reviews. When assessing this market, the logistics decision ranks above listing optimisation.
- **The category needs Korean certification.** Electronics, cosmetics, food and children's products each carry local entry requirements that do not transfer from US or EU schemes. Certification time and cost belong in the entry decision, not as something to sort out after listing.
- **Your volume cannot carry a local entity and returns.** A local company, a local return address and Korean-language support are ongoing costs. At low volume those fixed costs consume everything this market produces. Work out the break-even volume before deciding to enter.
