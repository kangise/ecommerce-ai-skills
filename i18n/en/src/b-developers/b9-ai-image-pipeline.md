## What You Will Build in This Module

- A ComfyUI product image generation workflow (white-background hero + scene shots + infographics)
- An API-driven batch image generation pipeline (Midjourney/GPT Image 2/FLUX.2)
- An automated product video generation system
- A brand visual consistency assurance mechanism

> **Core idea**: E-commerce product images are the number-one factor in conversion rate. The traditional approach is to hire a photographer ($500-2000/product); the AI approach is to generate with ComfyUI/Midjourney ($0-50/product). But AI generation isn't "one-click image creation" — you need to build a repeatable, controllable, brand-consistent pipeline.

## 1. Why You Need an AI Image Pipeline

### 1.1 E-commerce Image Demand Matrix

| Image type | Purpose | Quantity/product | Traditional cost | AI cost |
|------------|---------|------------------|------------------|---------|
| White-background hero | Amazon/Shopify main image | 1 | $100-300 | $0-5 |
| Scene shot | Use-case display | 3-5 | $200-500 | $5-20 |
| Infographic | Size/comparison/feature explanation | 2-3 | $100-200 | $5-10 |
| A+ Content | Brand story visuals | 5-7 | $300-500 | $10-30 |
| Social media | Instagram/TikTok assets | 10-20/month | $500-1000/month | $20-50/month |
| Ad creative | PPC/Meta/Google Ads | 5-10 variants | $200-500 | $10-30 |

### 1.2 Challenges of AI Image Generation

| Challenge | Description | Solution |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Product consistency | The AI-generated product appearance may differ from the real item | Use real product photos as reference (ControlNet/IP-Adapter) |
| Brand consistency | Different images have inconsistent styles | Fixed prompt prefix + Style Reference |
| Platform compliance | Amazon main images require pure white backgrounds | Post-process background removal + white-background compositing |
| Text rendering | AI-generated text is frequently wrong | Overlay text in post with Pillow/Canva |
| Copyright risk | AI may generate content similar to existing works | Use commercially licensed tools + human review |

---

## 3. ComfyUI Product Image Workflow

### 3.1 Installing ComfyUI

```bash
# Clone ComfyUI
git clone https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI.git
cd ComfyUI

# Install dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Download models (Flux recommended)
# Place model files in the models/checkpoints/ directory

# Launch
python3 main.py
# Open http://127.0.0.1:8188 in your browser
```

### 3.2 Product Image Generation Workflow

> **Real case: ComfyUI product photography workflow in practice**
> MyAIForce demonstrated a complete ComfyUI product image workflow: input a skincare product image and a descriptive prompt, and the workflow automatically blends the product seamlessly into a new background, adjusting lighting and shadows to match the new environment for a natural, harmonious look. The workflow has 7 steps: upload image → set background → basic adjustment → product positioning → relighting → inpainting → detail restoration ([MyAIForce](https://myaiforce.com/comfyui-product-photography/)).

> **Real case: Midjourney + ComfyUI combined workflow**
> Another advanced workflow combines Midjourney and ComfyUI: first use Midjourney to generate a high-quality scene background, then use ComfyUI's ControlNet and IP-Adapter to precisely place the product into the scene while adjusting lighting and shadows to preserve key details such as product text ([MyAIForce](https://myaiforce.com/product-photography-comfyui-midjourney/)).

> **Real case: ComfyUI background replacement V4 workflow**
> The latest V4 background-replacement workflow uses SDXL checkpoints, requiring only 10 sampling steps and about 6GB VRAM for basic tasks. Using Flux models yields higher-quality results but requires more VRAM ([MyAIForce](https://myaiforce.com/flux-replace-background-v4/)).

```
Complete ComfyUI e-commerce product image workflow (7 steps):

Step 1: Upload image and set background
Load Image node: load the real product photo
Background choice: upload a preset background or generate with a prompt
Parameter settings: resolution, sampling steps

Step 2: Basic adjustment
Product cutout (Florence2Run or rembg)
Size adjustment
Initial compositing

Step 3: Product positioning
Adjust the product's position in the frame
Scale ratio
Angle adjustment

Step 4: Relighting
IC-Light node: adjust product lighting to match the background
Shadow direction matching
Highlight adjustment

Step 5: Generate background
Flux Fill + Redux: generate a background matching the product
or IP-Adapter: replicate the style of a reference image
KSampler: execute generation

Step 6: Inpainting
Repair the seam between product and background
Add natural shadows
Detail blending

Step 7: Restore detail and color
Restore the product's original colors
Sharpen details
Final output
Save as PNG/JPEG
```

### 3.3 E-commerce Scene Prompt Templates (40+ tested templates)

> **Real resource**: Apatero compiled 40+ tested AI product image prompt templates covering all e-commerce scenarios — white background, scene, flat lay, infographic, and more ([Apatero](https://www.apatero.com/blog/best-prompts-product-photography-ai-generation-2025)).

> **What this chapter's Python scripts need** (separate from ComfyUI's own requirements.txt above): `pip install openai requests pillow rembg`

## 4. Cloud API Approaches

### 4.1 GPT Image 2 Batch Generation

```python
from openai import OpenAI
import requests
from pathlib import Path

client = OpenAI()

def generate_product_image(
    product_description: str,
    style: str = "white_background",
    size: str = "1024x1024",
    output_dir: str = "output"
) -> str:
    """Generate a product image with GPT Image 2"""

    prompts = {
        "white_background": f"Professional product photography of {product_description}, centered on pure white background, studio lighting, high resolution, commercial quality",
        "lifestyle": f"Lifestyle product photography of {product_description} being used in a modern home setting, natural lighting, warm tones, editorial quality",
        "amazon_main": f"Amazon product listing main image: {product_description}, pure white background (#FFFFFF), product fills 85% of frame, no text or logos, professional studio photography"
    }

    response = client.images.generate(
        model="gpt-image-2",
        prompt=prompts[style],
        size=size,
        quality="hd",
        n=1
    )

    # Download the image
    image_url = response.data[0].url
    Path(output_dir).mkdir(exist_ok=True)

    img_data = requests.get(image_url).content
    filepath = f"{output_dir}/{product_description[:30]}_{style}.png"
    with open(filepath, "wb") as f:
        f.write(img_data)

    return filepath

# Batch generation
products = [
    "wireless bluetooth earbuds with charging case",
    "stainless steel water bottle 32oz",
    "portable neck fan with LED display"
]

for product in products:
    for style in ["white_background", "lifestyle"]:
        path = generate_product_image(product, style)
        print(f"Generated: {path}")
```

### 4.2 Background Removal + White-Background Compositing

```python
from rembg import remove
from PIL import Image
import io

def create_amazon_main_image(input_path: str, output_path: str):
    """Create an Amazon-compliant white-background hero image"""
    # Read the image
    with open(input_path, "rb") as f:
        input_data = f.read()

    # Remove the background
    output_data = remove(input_data)

    # Create a white-background canvas
    fg = Image.open(io.BytesIO(output_data)).convert("RGBA")

    # Compute the product's proportion (Amazon requires 85%+)
    bbox = fg.getbbox()
    product_w = bbox[2] - bbox[0]
    product_h = bbox[3] - bbox[1]

    # Create a square white background (product occupies 85%)
    canvas_size = int(max(product_w, product_h) / 0.85)
    canvas = Image.new("RGBA", (canvas_size, canvas_size), (255, 255, 255, 255))

    # Center the product
    offset_x = (canvas_size - product_w) // 2 - bbox[0]
    offset_y = (canvas_size - product_h) // 2 - bbox[1]
    canvas.paste(fg, (offset_x, offset_y), fg)

    # Save as RGB (Amazon does not accept transparent backgrounds)
    canvas.convert("RGB").save(output_path, "JPEG", quality=95)
    print(f"Amazon main image saved: {output_path}")
```

                              num_variants: int = 3) -> list:
    """Generate multiple hero-image variants for A/B testing"""
    variants = []

    # Variant 1: different angles
    angles = ["front view centered", "45 degree angle", "slight top-down angle"]

## 6. AI Video Generation

### 6.1 Product Video Types

| Type | Duration | Purpose | AI tool |
|------|----------|---------|---------|
| Product showcase | 15-30s | Amazon video, Shopify | Kling 3 / Seedance 2 |
| Usage tutorial | 30-60s | A+ Content, YouTube | Synthesia / HeyGen |
| Social short video | 15-60s | TikTok/Reels/Shorts | CapCut AI / Runway Gen-4.5 |
| Ad video | 6-15s | PPC video ads | Runway Gen-4.5 / Veo 3.1 |

### 6.2 Product Showcase Video Generation

```python
# Conceptual code: generate a product showcase video with the Runway API
import runway

def generate_product_video(
    product_image: str,
    motion_prompt: str = "slow 360 degree rotation, studio lighting",
    duration: int = 4 # seconds
) -> str:
    """Generate a showcase video from a product image"""

    task = runway.image_to_video.create(
        model="gen3a_turbo",
        prompt_image=product_image,
        prompt_text=motion_prompt,
        duration=duration
    )

    # Wait for generation to complete
    task = runway.tasks.retrieve(task.id)
    while task.status != "SUCCEEDED":
        import time
        time.sleep(5)
        task = runway.tasks.retrieve(task.id)

    return task.output[0] # Video URL
```

## 7. Quality Control & Compliance

### 7.1 Amazon Image Compliance Check

```python
def check_amazon_compliance(image_path: str) -> dict:
    """Check whether an image meets Amazon requirements"""
    img = Image.open(image_path)
    issues = []

    # Size check (minimum 1000px)
    if min(img.size) < 1000:
        issues.append(f"Insufficient size: {img.size}, minimum 1000x1000 required")

    # White-background check (hero image)
    pixels = list(img.getdata())
    corners = [pixels[0], pixels[img.width-1],
               pixels[-img.width], pixels[-1]]
    for i, corner in enumerate(corners):
        if not all(c > 240 for c in corner[:3]):
            issues.append(f"Corner {i} is not pure white: {corner}")

    # Product proportion check
    # ... (check whether the product occupies 85%+ of the frame)

    return {
        "compliant": len(issues) == 0,
        "issues": issues,
        "size": img.size,
        "format": img.format
    }
```

### 7.2 Brand Consistency Check

| Check item | Method | Tool |
|------------|--------|------|
| Color consistency | Extract the dominant color and compare with the brand color | Pillow + ColorThief |
| Style consistency | CLIP embedding similarity | sentence-transformers |
| Logo position | Template check | Pillow |
| Text font | OCR + font matching | Tesseract |

## 8. Common Traps

### 8.1 Using text-to-image for the main product shot

Text-to-image re-imagines your product; details, proportions, and logo drift. The product itself must go image-to-image or image-to-video from a real photo. This is a compliance issue as much as a quality one.

### 8.2 Not keeping metadata on generated images

Which image is AI-generated, with what tool, when — under the EU AI Act's transparency duties you need to be able to answer this. See [A6 §5](../a-operators/a6-compliance.md).

### 8.3 Batch generating with no human screening

AI image yield is lower than people assume, especially on hands, text, reflections, and material rendering. The pipeline needs a human spot-check stage; the rate can be low but not zero.

### 8.4 Ignoring per-platform image specs

White background for the main image, minimum dimensions, text-coverage limits — rules differ by platform. Generate without those constraints and you'll either be rejected or redo the work.

---

## When this doesn't work

- **The image has to represent the physical object honestly.** Generation cannot show what a material feels like. Anything in the main or detail images conveying material, colour or size must be photographed; keep generated imagery to scene and atmosphere. A buyer receiving something that does not match pays you in returns and negative reviews, and some platforms treat it as a misleading image.
- **A set has to read as the same product.** Generation is stochastic — lighting, colour temperature and orientation drift between runs. Placed side by side, main, lifestyle, detail and A+ images that drift hurt conversion more than one merely mediocre image. Consistency means fixing the seed, running img2img from one reference, or shooting for real and treating afterwards.
- **The platform's AI-content policy changed recently.** Main-image rules and AI-content labelling requirements have been moving for a few years, and the EU AI Act's transparency clause reaches directly into this (see [A6](../a-operators/a6-compliance.md)). Confirm your target platform's current position before running a batch. Do not apply last year's understanding to this year's volume.
- **You do not have enough SKUs to justify the pipeline.** Batch generation plus post-processing plus compliance checking amortises across dozens or hundreds of SKUs. With a dozen, generating them one at a time in an off-the-shelf tool and picking by hand is faster than maintaining a pipeline.

## 9. Completion Checklist

- [ ] Set up ComfyUI or choose an API approach
- [ ] Generate a complete image set for one product (hero + scene + infographic)
- [ ] Implement an automated background-removal + white-background-compositing flow
- [ ] Build a batch generation pipeline (process 5+ products at once)
- [ ] Pass the Amazon image compliance check
- [ ] Generate at least 1 product showcase video
