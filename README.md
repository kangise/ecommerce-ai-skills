# Cross-Border E-Commerce AI Knowledge Base

### Read it as a book. Install it as agent capability. Run it as operations.

**Every number CI-verified · Every prompt carries anti-hallucination guardrails · Every chapter states when the method breaks**

<br>

## What This Is

An AI operations knowledge base for cross-border e-commerce. **One source, three uses:**

| Use | What it is | Entry |
|---|---|---|
| **Read it** | 69 chapters, sourcing to growth, complete in zh/en/ja | [Online site](https://kangise.github.io/ecommerce-ai-skills/) |
| **Install it for your agent** | Knowledge + domain model + guarded capabilities, one MCP config line to Claude / Cursor | [`dist/`](dist/) |
| **Run it** | Commerce Agent OS — an operations runtime on real store data, with multi-agent review and human approval | `opc-ecommerce demo` |

All three are held to the **same CI gates**. Gates fail, nothing ships.

<br>

## Run It — Commerce Agent OS

The first two uses hand knowledge to an AI. The third **puts it to work** — the same ontology and skills inside a runtime with approval, audit, and failure recovery.

```bash
pip install "ecommerce-ai-skills[mcp] @ git+https://github.com/kangise/ecommerce-ai-skills"

opc-ecommerce demo-seed --db ./demo.sqlite     # isolated demo tenant
opc-ecommerce demo --db ./demo.sqlite --port 8788
# open http://127.0.0.1:8788/app
```

The demo tenant is marked `DEMO DATA` throughout and is physically isolated from real data.

**What it does today**

| Capability | Detail |
|---|---|
| Real data in | Amazon SP-API / Amazon Ads / Shopify connectors; Business Report, Ads, FBA, returns, and listing CSV/XLSX import once as durable Evidence |
| Multi-agent review | Weekly Ops Council: an evidence agent and one specialist per marketplace review in parallel, then a cross-platform controller and store manager set priorities |
| Human approval gate | Writes go through proposal → approval → execution; advertising actions carry an extra capability gate and are blocked without authorization |
| Durable execution | Four worker classes (job / schedule / report-sync / daily-ops) resume after interruption, with idempotency leases and recovery |
| Full audit trail | Every conclusion must cite its input source; tenant isolation, API key rotation, operation audit log |
| Operations UI | `/app` with seven views — briefing, agents, evidence, approvals, connections, automation, audit; persisted zh/en preference, light and dark themes |

**Model providers**: OpenAI by default; set `EAI_AGENT_PROVIDER=anthropic` to run on Claude. Both providers share one contract — credentials stay environment-only, the endpoint is pinned to the official host, and the audit record names the provider actually used. An unrecognised value fails at startup rather than rerouting silently.

**What it deliberately refuses to do** — without real credentials or complete evidence it **fails explicitly** rather than producing plausible-looking placeholder results. Same principle as the data discipline in the knowledge layer.

Integration details in [`integration/runtime-api.md`](integration/runtime-api.md).

## Who You Are → Where to Start

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/paths-en.svg" alt="Four entry paths: a solo seller 3 min, finding AI knowledge for an agent 5 min, a team wanting one unified SOP same-day, learning the capability-packaging method" width="100%">
</p>

<br>

## Why Not Just Another Prompt Collection

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/guardrail-en.svg" alt="The same question: an ordinary prompt invents plausible numbers, while this library's prompt stops and asks you for the data because of its three guardrails" width="100%">
</p>

Ask an AI "roughly how much does this category sell per month?" and it will almost always hand you a plausible-looking number — **one it does not actually know**.

Sourcing, restocking, and pricing have real money behind them. The agent era makes it worse: a model acts on numbers it doesn't know to adjust prices and place orders.

**The difference isn't fancier prompts — it's drawing the line where AI stops.**

## 30-Second Demo

Paste this into [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) or [Claude](https://claude.ai/):

```
<role>Cross-border sourcing consultant familiar with Amazon [US/DE/JP]</role>

<my_conditions>
- Startup capital: ¥[X]0K
- Experience level: [beginner/experienced/veteran]
- Preferred categories: [write your preference, or "no preference"]
- Risk appetite: [conservative/medium/aggressive]
</my_conditions>

<tool_data>
[Optional. Paste category data exported from Helium 10 / Jungle Scout. If empty, see data_discipline below]
</tool_data>

<task>
Recommend 5 category directions, each with:
1. Category name and brief description
2. Why this may be an opportunity now (state the basis for your judgment)
3. What data I need to verify to confirm it (name the specific metrics and the tool to pull them from)
4. Main risks and mitigations
5. Order-of-magnitude read on startup capital (can my stated budget cover it?)
6. Recommended entry strategy (differentiation direction)
</task>

<data_discipline>
- **Do not give specific monthly sales, price, or margin figures** unless they appear in <tool_data>. You do not have live market data, and an invented number leads me to stock the wrong product
- When <tool_data> is empty, item 3 matters most: tell me what to look up rather than guessing the answer for me
- Tag each conclusion: [tool data] or [category-level inference]
- If you lack the basis for a judgment, ask me for the data before concluding
</data_discipline>

<constraints>
- Don't recommend already-red-ocean categories (phone cases, cables)
- Prioritize categories with room for differentiation
- Respect my capital and experience limits
</constraints>

<output_format>
Recommend exactly 5 category directions, each following the fixed 6-item structure from <task> above:
1. Category name and brief description (1–2 sentences)
2. Why this may be an opportunity now (basis for the judgment)
3. Data to verify (specific metrics + the tool to pull them)
4. Main risks and mitigations
5. Order-of-magnitude read on startup capital (can my budget cover it?)
6. Recommended entry strategy (differentiation direction)
</output_format>

<self_check>
Before delivering, confirm: (1) no number appears that I didn't provide, (2) every category states what to verify next, (3) exactly 5 recommendations
</self_check>

Note:
- Don't recommend already-red-ocean categories (phone cases, cables)
- Prioritize categories with room for differentiation
- Account for my capital and experience limits

<copy_discipline>
- Never write a feature, material, certification, or result the product doesn't have. Any attribute I didn't state above must not appear in the copy
- For anything sent to a customer (replies, emails, templates), don't make commitments I haven't authorized: refund amounts, compensation, timelines, or exceptions to platform policy must be confirmed by me before they go in
- Flag any claim touching efficacy, safety, environmental, or patent language separately for manual review
</copy_discipline>
```

**Notice how it doesn't fabricate numbers** — it tells you exactly which figures to look up yourself. From [A1 Product Research · 3.7 Category Opportunity Discovery](src/a-operators/a1-product-research.md).

<br>

## Three Real Usage Scenarios

### 1 · Write an Amazon Listing for a new product (no coding required)

Open [A2 Listing Optimization](src/a-operators/a2-listing-optimization.md), copy the "full-listing generation" prompt, and fill in your product info.

You get a listing with **platform hard constraints** baked in: title ≤200 characters with the highest-search-volume keyword in the first 80, 5 bullets each ≤200 characters with no HTML, backend Search Terms ≤250 bytes per line.

> These aren't rules we made up — they're Amazon's actual limits, stored in [`ontology/constraints.yaml`](ontology/constraints.yaml), and the prompt's `<self_check>` block verifies each one. Change a constraint once, and gate `O5` makes every prompt referencing it change together.

### 2 · Turn Claude Desktop into an e-commerce consultant (5 minutes)

Install the server dependencies first:

```bash
python3 -m pip install "ecommerce-ai-skills[mcp] @ git+https://github.com/kangise/ecommerce-ai-skills"
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "opc-ecommerce": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["/path/to/ecommerce-ai-skills/integration/mcp-server.py", "--dist", "/path/to/ecommerce-ai-skills/dist"]
    }
  }
}
```

After install:

| You ask | What it does |
|---|---|
| "ACOS is up to 40%, what do I do?" | Routes to `ecom-advertising` — a diagnostic path, not generic advice |
| "Should I use AI for demand forecasting?" | Routes to `ecom-applicability` — **answers "not with under a year of data"**, because it has every chapter's failure boundaries installed |
| "How do I reply to a complaint that the product doesn't match the photos?" | Routes to `ecom-customer-service` — reply templates with copy discipline |

See [dist/integration/mcp.md](dist/integration/mcp.md).

### 3 · Cross-platform launches for your team, no rules to memorize

The same "title" is a different thing on each of three platforms — look it up in [`ontology/constraints.yaml`](ontology/constraints.yaml):

```yaml
amazon.listing.title.max_length:       200  characters
shopify.product_page.title.max_length:  70  characters
tiktok_shop.product.title.max_length:   80  characters
```

When the team asks in the group chat again, just share the link. Or use the `ecom-listing` skill to generate compliant variants for all three platforms in one go.

<br>

## Not Just a Book — Four Layers

| Layer | Contents | Scale | For |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Knowledge Base** | 69 chapters, trilingual (zh/en/ja) | 69 chapters | Human reading · agent retrieval |
| **Ontology** | E-commerce domain model | 100 entities · 322 constraints · 78 relations · 8 processes | Shared contract between agents |
| **Skills + Prompts** | Guarded executable capabilities | 878 prompts · 9 installable skills | Agent direct invocation |
| **Runtime** | Multi-agent operations runtime + UI | 54 API endpoints · 7 views · 3 platform connectors | Day-to-day operation of a real store |

The first three layers are **knowledge**; the fourth **connects them to real data and executes**. The first three ship in `dist/`; the fourth is the `pip install` runtime package.

`dist/` directory structure:

```
dist/
  SKILL.md       ← Agent entry point — read it to know how to route requests
  ontology.json  ← E-commerce domain model (entities, relations, constraints)
  prompts.json   ← Guardrailed prompts, trilingual
  skills/        ← 9 domain skills, each with manifest + playbook + boundaries
  knowledge/     ← Structured index of the 69 chapters
  integration/   ← MCP server setup guide
```

The MCP server exposes 8 resources (the five ontology files + knowledge index + full chapter text + glossary) and 5 tools (`route_query` / `get_constraints` / `search_knowledge` / `read_chapter` / `list_skills`). Check it yourself:

```bash
python3 integration/mcp-server.py --cli
```

Point it at a running runtime (`OPC_RUNTIME_URL` + `OPC_RUNTIME_API_KEY`) and four **read-only** ops tools appear: briefing, metric observations, pending actions, imported evidence. The agent then knows not only what to do about a 40% ACOS, but what the ACOS actually is.

Approval is not exposed. Writes go proposal → human approval → execution, and making `approve` a tool would hand the model the key to the gate. An agent can see what is waiting; a person still approves it.

<br>

## Why Trust This Content

Not because "we're careful" — because of **43 CI gates**. Every gate must pass or the build stops:

| Gate | What it checks |
|---|---|
| `M1` | Every hard number in the text has a source, a verification date, a hedge word, or an explicit flag |
| `M2` | Every how-to chapter has a "when this doesn't work" section |
| `M4` | Every external link has been probed and isn't dead |
| `M7` | `verified` markers older than 18 months auto-expire with an error |
| `N3` `N4` | Every prompt has a self-check block and an output format |
| `O5` | Constraint values written in the text must match the ontology |
| `parity` | All three language files exist and have matching structure |

Run it yourself:

```bash
python3 scripts/verify_all.py
```

> The full gate list and design rationale are in [`scripts/README.md`](scripts/README.md). Known open items are written down in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md), not hidden.
