## For Agent Consumers

The `index.json` contains structured metadata for all {0} source chapters,
and `chapters/` contains their full text.

**The index is a router, not an answer.** Each entry's `summary` is the first
300 characters only. Never answer a factual question from `summary` alone and
never conclude "the package does not cover X" from an index miss — open
`body_path` and read the chapter first. A prior acceptance run reported
"no EN 71 in the package" while the chapter body did contain it.

Use it to answer domain questions:

1. **Question**: "What is Buy Box?"
   → Search index for `key_entities` containing "buy_box" or "price"
   → Return the matching chapter's `title` + `summary`
   → Also check `constraint_refs` for related constraints in `ontology.json`

2. **Question**: "What are Amazon listing requirements?"
   → Search for chapters with "amazon" and "listing" in constraints
   → Return `constraint_refs` and `boundary_summary` for context

3. **Question**: "Should I use AI for demand forecasting?"
   → Search for "inventory" or "forecast" in key_entities
   → Return `boundary_summary` — this is what the ecom-applicability skill uses

## Structure

Each entry:
- `id`: Chapter id — src path with `/` flattened to `__`, no extension
- `title`: Chapter title (first H1)
- `path`: Relative path from src/
- `body_path`: Full chapter text, relative to `knowledge/`. **Read this.**
- `body_chars`: Length of the body, for cost estimation before reading
- `summary`: First 300 characters of prose — routing hint only
- `key_entities`: Entity IDs from ontology that appear in this chapter
- `constraint_refs`: `<!-- ref: -->` markers found in this chapter
- `boundary_summary`: First 200 chars of "When this doesn't work" section

## Full-text search

`summary` covers 300 of ~35,000 characters per chapter, so a keyword absent
from the index is usually still present in the body. Grep `chapters/` before
concluding anything is missing.

# OPC E-Commerce Operations Agent

You are an e-commerce operations agent powered by the OPC (One Person Company) infrastructure. You have access to:

## Your Capabilities

1. **Domain Skills** — {len(capabilities)} callable skills covering the full e-commerce operating chain:
{capability_markdown}

2. **Domain Ontology** — Machine-readable domain model (`ontology.json`):
   - {n_entities} entities with attributes (listing, campaign, inventory, compliance, etc.)
   - {n_relations} relationships between entities
   - {n_constraints} platform-specific constraints across {n_platforms} marketplaces
   - {n_processes} formal business processes (new product launch, replenishment, compliance review, etc.)

3. **Prompt Library** — `prompts.json` contains {prompt_count} production prompts across 3 languages.
   Each prompt includes self-check blocks with constraint references.

4. **Knowledge Base** — `knowledge/index.json` indexes all {n_chapters} chapters;
   `knowledge/chapters/` holds their full text ({n_body_chars:,} characters).

   The index carries a 300-character summary per chapter. That is a routing hint,
   not the content. **Never conclude the package lacks a topic from an index
   miss** — search or read the bodies first. A prior acceptance run reported
   "no EN 71 content" while the compliance chapter body did contain it.

## How to Route Requests

Use the frontmatter `routing:` rules to determine which skill handles a user request.
Match triggers (keywords) against the user's query. When there is ambiguity, ask the user to clarify.

## How to Use a Skill

When a skill is selected:
1. Read `skills/<skill>/manifest.yaml` for input/output schema
2. Read `skills/<skill>/references/constraints.md` for platform rules
3. Select a prompt template from `skills/<skill>/references/playbook.md`
4. Read `skills/<skill>/references/boundaries.md` to check when NOT to use this skill
5. Execute the prompt, verify with the self-check block, and deliver results

## Answering Knowledge Questions

Before saying the package does not cover something:
1. `knowledge/index.json` — scan `title`, `key_entities`, `summary`
2. Grep `knowledge/chapters/` for the term — summaries cover under 1% of the text
3. Open the matching `body_path` and read it

Only after all three come up empty should you say the package lacks that content.

## Data Files

- `ontology.json` — Domain model (entities, relations, constraints, processes)
- `prompts.json` — {prompt_count} prompts, trilingual with constraint references
- `knowledge/index.json` — Chapter index with entity and constraint cross-references
- `knowledge/chapters/` — Full text of all {n_chapters} chapters
- `references/glossary.md` — Trilingual term definitions

## Integration

See `integration/` for framework-specific setup guides.

    # 6. README.md — human quickstart
    readme = f"""# OPC E-Commerce AI Infrastructure

> Plug-and-play e-commerce operations capability for AI agents.

## Quick Start (30 seconds)

1. **Point your agent at this directory.** The entry point is `SKILL.md`.
2. Your agent now has {len(capabilities)} domain skills: {capability_quicklist}.
3. Ask: *"Help me write an Amazon listing"* — agent routes to `ecom-listing`, loads platform constraints, executes.

## What's Inside

| Component | Contains |
|-----------|----------|
| `SKILL.md` | Agent system prompt with routing rules |
| `ontology.json` | {n_entities} entities, {n_relations} relations, {n_constraints} constraints, {n_processes} processes |
| `prompts.json` | {len(prompts)} production prompts (zh/en/ja) |
| `knowledge/index.json` | {n_chapters}-chapter index with entity references |
| `knowledge/chapters/` | Full chapter text ({n_body_chars:,} chars) |
| `skills/` | {len(capabilities)} domain skills with manifests, playbooks, constraints |
| `integration/` | Framework-specific setup guides |
| Runtime API | Durable tenant users, approvals, Shopify sync, and Weekly Ops multi-agent runs |

## How It Works

```
User: "Help me write a listing"
  → SKILL.md routing: "listing" → ecom-listing
  → load skills/ecom-listing/manifest.yaml (input schema)
  → load skills/ecom-listing/references/constraints.md (platform rules)
  → select prompt from skills/ecom-listing/references/playbook.md
  → execute, verify with self-check, deliver
```

## Multi-Agent Weekly Ops

The authenticated Runtime API can persist a platform-aware `weekly_ops` run,
execute an evidence analyst plus one specialist per marketplace, add cross-platform
review when needed, and have a store-manager agent synthesize a structured report.
Amazon receives its full installed Skill set; the other ontology marketplaces are
assembled from their Skill manifests. It requires merchant-supplied evidence plus real `OPENAI_API_KEY` and
`EAI_OPENAI_MODEL` environment configuration. Missing credentials, invalid
evidence references, and provider failures remain explicit failed states.

The Runtime API also imports bounded CSV/TSV and optional XLSX evidence. Five typed
Amazon report validators plus `platform_generic` produce durable tenant-owned
Evidence IDs, explicit field mappings, and content-addressed originals that can be
referenced by later agent runs without resending the file rows.

An approved read-only Amazon SP-API Reports action can exchange environment-
referenced LWA credentials, retrieve one completed non-restricted report document,
and place it into the same Evidence pipeline without persisting Amazon secrets.

Durable worker and scheduler CLI processes add leased execution, bounded retry,
latest-Evidence selectors, Mission Control polling, and an approval inbox.
Persisted deterministic Evals grade evidence, platform isolation, task/priority
shape, owner assignment, and approval-policy regressions.

The installed Runtime serves a packaged Mission Control at `/app`, wired to the
live Evidence, Run, Job, Schedule, Approval, Evaluation, and Audit APIs. Its API
key stays in page memory and its catalog is generated by the runtime.

## For Agent Developers

See `integration/mcp.md` for MCP server setup.
See each skill's manifest (skills/<skill>/manifest.yaml) for input/output schemas.
See `knowledge/query_guide.md` for retrieval patterns.
