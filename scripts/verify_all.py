# R1b — sentence-fragment triggers
#
# Manifest `triggers.keywords` must be domain vocabulary — words another
# e-commerce document would contain. What R1b guards against is the specific
# failure mode this repo has hit twice:
#
#   User writes a natural test case:  「AI 给出的分析结论，我要不要让人再核一遍」
#   Router misses it (no keyword).
#   Instead of accepting the R1 miss, someone chops the case into fragments
#   and pastes them into manifest triggers: 「再核一遍」, 「要不要让人」, 「人再核」.
#   R1 goes green. R1's anti-degeneration flags the rising literal ratio;
#   somebody raises R1's threshold to 95% to make that green too.
#   Both moves happened in the same commit.
#
# R1b makes the fragmentation step machine-visible so it can't be quiet.
#
# The MARKERS list is what a genuine domain term would not contain — pronouns
# (这个/我的), question tails (吗/怎么办/要不要), hedges (还能/到底/一直),
# quantity questions (多少/多久), and specific residues actually observed in
# past back-copying (跑出来/模型跑/坐住/清掉).
#
# ALLOWLIST is the escape hatch: a keyword may look like a fragment but be
# legitimate because it carries an explicit domain noun (AI, Amazon, ACOS, …).
# These are listed explicitly here rather than derived, so every exception is
# visible in one place and reviewable.
